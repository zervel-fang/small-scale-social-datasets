# small-scale-social-datasets and IS algorithm
# four small-scale datasets

This repository cotains the IS algorithm used in the paper "Predicting information spreading in social media from individual behaviour"
1. The project cotains two versions of IS algorithm, directed and undirected. 
2. To run the algorithm in command line, you just need to use the command: ./main.sh.
3. In the sh file, we complie it by the gcc complier, it can run in parallel in PC or one compute node of the server. 
4. Any question about the program and our paper "Quantify individual influence and susceptibility in social networks", please feel free to contact with me, my e-mail address: zervel3@std.uestc.edu.cn. If you like the project, please fork and star it.
